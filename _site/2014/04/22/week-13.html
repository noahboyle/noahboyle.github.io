<h1 id="uncube-magazine">UNCUBE MAGAZINE</h1>

<p>This <a href="http://www.uncubemagazine.com/magazines">site</a> does a great job of using the full width of the screen with animations.  When you move into one of the issues of the magazines you are immediately presented with attractive, large imagery and an interactive, well-animated table of contents.  Throughout the experience of the online magazine, it mimics the analog qualities of phyiscal magazines by asking the user to scroll side to side instead of top-down.  However, it does not waste all of its time simply mimicking analog magazines, it also utilizes the most powerful assets of the online world: the 4th dimension and a simplistic, yet elegant interface.  </p>
