<h1 id="coachella">COACHELLA</h1>

<p>This <a href="http://www.coachella.com/">site</a> is possibly the best music festival website I have encountered recently.  I love its simplistic iconagraphy which acts as a sort of digital wayfinding in the online landscape as well as its space-themed backgrounds.  Unlike most festival websites, the information is easy to access and to udnerstand, but still retains a certain degree of visual elegance.  Admist the depths of festival information lives the fantastic coachella banner image which subtely captures the whimsy of the festival in a series of attractive animations.  Finally the festival features a sortable, searchable line-up page where you can not only gain more insight into the lives of the artists but you can listen to their music too.  </p>
