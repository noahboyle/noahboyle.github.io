<h1 id="hours-of-happy">24 HOURS OF HAPPY</h1>

<p>Lovely marriage between music, video, web, and social media. <a href="http://24hoursofhappy.com/">The site</a> literally functions as a 24 hour music video with each shot actually being filmed at the hour of day on the virtual clock. Pharrell song repeats over and over again for the 24 hour span and using the clock widget users can scroll to any point in the video. To engage social media users there is an option to share any point of the song with your friends so that there becomes bookmarks for interesting moments in the experience. Although the videos are simple in concept, they become brilliant when placed in the web context.</p>
