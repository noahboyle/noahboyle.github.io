<h1 id="names-for-change">NAMES FOR CHANGE</h1>

<p>This <a href="https://www.namesforchange.org/">site</a> is stunning.  Their color palette is superb and I think they did a great job of creating a layout which makes somewhat banal content imagery appear as eye candy.  I love the css &amp; jquery animations that they have included with each pledge object, dynamically shifting the shape from a rectangle to a circle.  The large type and fullscreen experience compeltes the look, ultimately forming a very useable, very beautiful site design.</p>
