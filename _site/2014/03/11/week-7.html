<h1 id="facebook-paper">FACEBOOK PAPER</h1>

<p>I recently stumbled upon the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paper/">facebook paper app</a> and was blown away by its ability to maintain ease of use while pushing interface design forward in a huge way. I love the way you can simply tilt the phone to see the left and right portions of horizontal photos and its thumb-based navigation. Even the website for the app is wuite well done in the way that it describes the app visually and encompasses the whole screen. Overall it was a great step for facebook to move forward and engage their younger and/or ultra-tech-savvy users.</p>
