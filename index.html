		MOMA SURREAL EXHIBIT - 
		
		An amazing online exhibit created by Hello Monday.  I love the custom, trippy transitions, the great use of avant-garde music, and the experiential quality of the whole site.  It is very inventive and engaging, it brought me into a world of an artist I had never heard of and kept me there for a while.  I have no idea how it was built but this project is especially what cemented my interest in the firm Hello Monday.

		24 HOURS OF HAPPY - 
		
		Lovely marriage between music, video, web, and social media.  The site literally functions as a 24 hour music video with each shot actually being filmed at the hour of day on the virtual clock.  Pharrellâ€™s song repeats over and over again for the 24 hour span and using the clock widget users can scroll to any point in the video.  To engage social media users there is an option to share any point of the song with your friends so that there becomes bookmarks for interesting moments in the experience.  Although the videos are simple in concept, they become brilliant when placed in the web context.
