		MOMA SURREAL EXHIBIT - 
		
		An amazing online exhibit created by Hello Monday.  I love the custom, trippy transitions, the great use of avant-garde music, and the experiential quality of the whole site.  It is very inventive and engaging, it brought me into a world of an artist I had never heard of and kept me there for a while.  I have no idea how it was built but this project is especially what cemented my interest in the firm Hello Monday.

		24 HOURS OF HAPPY - 
		
		Lovely marriage between music, video, web, and social media.  The site literally functions as a 24 hour music video with each shot actually being filmed at the hour of day on the virtual clock.  Pharrell song repeats over and over again for the 24 hour span and using the clock widget users can scroll to any point in the video.  To engage social media users there is an option to share any point of the song with your friends so that there becomes bookmarks for interesting moments in the experience.  Although the videos are simple in concept, they become brilliant when placed in the web context.

		CLOUDS OVER CUBA - 
		
		When I picture new media cinema, I picture Clouds over Cuba.  Within the website there is an entire, 
		historically accurate portrayal of the cold war tensions in astounding, interactive form.  I myself am
		already very fascinated by this topic but this piece really breathes new life into it for me.  I appreciate
		The use of typography throughout the website, using fonts which cater to the seriousness of the topic but
		simultaneously feel very fresh and modern.  However, for me the best part is the draggable timeline beneath
		the video feed which allows for a much more personalized documentary experience by utilizing everything

		WIND VISUALIZATION - 
		
		I have always really loved this wind visualization project.  From a web design standpoint its quite simple 
		in terms of its page layout.  However, the actual visualization itself is amazingly beautiful.  To be able 
		to see all of the wind patterns for the entire nation in one animated image gets me every time.  Not only
		is it beautiful but it is also easily understood and serves an informational purpose.  Great web project!

		PITCHFORK ADVANCE - 
		
		I am a huge fan of this web project.  It has a wonderful, minimalistic interface which highlights the album artwork
		and even allows for videos to be played with the songs.  The scroll bars on the sides add another dimensionality
		to the experience, emulating flipping through album artwork.  This interface is not simply just another way
		to consume music but it is an experience.

		KANYE WEST - 
		
		Kanye WEst's website is not exactly the most intense spectacle of web design ever imagined but I really appreicate 
		it nonetheless.  What I appreciate about it is the intelligence of its design from a display standpoint.  
		The most important content is all you can see initially followed by the tour information.  There is no fluff,
		no category headings, etcetera.  There is only what Kanye wants you to see the most.  I think in this ADD
		age we live in, this is the best approach an artist can take, especially one of Kanye's stature.'
