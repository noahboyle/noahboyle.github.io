		MOMA SURREAL EXHIBIT - 
		
		An amazing online exhibit created by Hello Monday.  I love the custom, trippy transitions, the great use of avant-garde music, and the experiential quality of the whole site.  It is very inventive and engaging, it brought me into a world of an artist I had never heard of and kept me there for a while.  I have no idea how it was built but this project is especially what cemented my interest in the firm Hello Monday.
