# CLOUDS OVER CUBA

When I picture new media cinema, I picture Clouds over Cuba. Within [the site](http://cloudsovercuba.com/) there is an entire, historically accurate portrayal of the cold war tensions in astounding, interactive form. I myself am already very fascinated by this topic but this piece really breathes new life into it for me. I appreciate The use of typography throughout the website, using fonts which cater to the seriousness of the topic but simultaneously feel very fresh and modern. However, for me the best part is the draggable timeline beneath the video feed which allows for a much more personalized documentary experience by utilizing everything.
