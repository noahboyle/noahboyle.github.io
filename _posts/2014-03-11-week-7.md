# FACEBOOK PAPER

![facebook](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52ea3ac86bb3f72705631eeb-1200-924/facebook-paper-news-reading-app.jpg?1111233/300/300)

I recently stumbled upon the [facebook paper app](https://www.facebook.com/paper/) and was blown away by its ability to maintain ease of use while pushing interface design forward in a huge way. I love the way you can simply tilt the phone to see the left and right portions of horizontal photos and its thumb-based navigation. Even the website for the app is wuite well done in the way that it describes the app visually and encompasses the whole screen. Overall it was a great step for facebook to move forward and engage their younger and/or ultra-tech-savvy users.
