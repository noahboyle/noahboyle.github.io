# KANYE WEST

![yeezus](http://www.videostatic.com/sites/default/files/styles/post/public/kanye-west-black-skinheads1.jpg?itok=0sw0_X9Z?1111233/300/300)

Kanye West's [website](http://kanyewest.com) is not exactly the most intense spectacle of web design ever imagined but I really appreicate it nonetheless. What I appreciate about it is the intelligence of its design from a display standpoint. The most important content is all you can see initially followed by the tour information. There is no fluff, no category headings, etcetera. There is only what Kanye wants you to see the most. I think in this ADD age we live in, this is the best approach an artist can take, especially one of Kanye's stature.
