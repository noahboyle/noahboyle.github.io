# ICEBERGS

![names](http://viatecno.com/img/post/icebergslogobg1000x600-800x480.gif)

This [site](https://icebergs.com/) is like dropbox on steroids.  Not only is their interface and general site design more appealing than the more utilitarian feel of dropbox, the site is host to far more capabilities as well.  It gives users the ability to save nearly anything they find on the web in their iceberg collection within the cloud.  Once there your collection loads in a beautiful stream of thumbnailed images, text, videos, etcetera.  When I discovered this website the other day, it literally revolutionized my thesis research process.
