# NAMES FOR CHANGE

![names](https://48203b784325cc4e0c57-2c542d4e4276372ded880c8bce99d3eb.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/item-31Mb94-large.jpg)

This [site](https://www.namesforchange.org/) is stunning.  Their color palette is superb and I think they did a great job of creating a layout which makes somewhat banal content imagery appear as eye candy.  I love the css & jquery animations that they have included with each pledge object, dynamically shifting the shape from a rectangle to a circle.  The large type and fullscreen experience compeltes the look, ultimately forming a very useable, very beautiful site design.
