# AN IDEA LIVES ON

![art](http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/interactive/2013/11/jfk_an_idea_lives_on.jpg)

This [site](http://anidealiveson.org/#home) is a super-engaging snippet of historical documentation.  The elegant typefaces and color pallette perfectly suit the vibes of the website itself and enhance the user experience in a big way.  There are wonderful halftone textures and sweeping loading animations which make it feel far more arresting than the typical dry documentary.  There are several historical video moments as well as options for audience participation in the evolution of the website's featured story.  It acts as a fitting retrospective into the life of a very historic man.
