# ART COPY CODE

![art](http://www.hudsonhouston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/art-code-int-1024x565.jpg)

This [site](http://www.artcopycode.com/#/) is a great example of interactive storytelling online.  It paints a picture of online advancements over the years and what that means for web users and creatives.  I love their use of large graphics and subtle scrolling animations which keep me engaged in my whole passage through the site.  Also they use color in a very smart way to designate category headings.  Even though the site is one large scrolling experience they include lovely little navbar animations to let the user know when they have reached a new section, working in unison with their established color categorizations.  This then links to various proof-of-concept experiments which expand this paradigm even further.
