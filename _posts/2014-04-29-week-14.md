# SPOTIFY

I was unsure about the interface of [spotify](https://spotify.com) until I was recently shown their aesthetic refresh a couple days ago.  The new design feels far more elegant and modern than the old interface design while still retaining spotify's basic DNA.  Although I am currently a subscriber to Rdio, I must admit I was a bit tempted by the seductive qualities of this new interface, especially in the design of their web player.  The way that they have each new level from search to albums to play, open a little to the right of the previous window, feels groundbreaking to me.  I've never seen a site before which operates in this manner.  To me it speaks to the feeling of slipping through vinyl at a record store but in a gorgeous digital landscape.
